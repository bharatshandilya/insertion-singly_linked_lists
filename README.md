# insertion-singly_linked_lists
This repository contains c programs demonstrating basic linked lists operations.
Each file focuses on a different insertion technique using a singly linked list.

---

## Files

- `traverse.c` → Traverses and prints all elements of the linked list.  
- `insertAtFront.c` → Inserts a new node at the **beginning** of the list.  
- `insertAtEnd.c` → Inserts a new node at the **end** of the list.  
- `insertInBetween.c` → Inserts a new node at a given **index/position**.  
- `insertAfterNode.c` → Inserts a new node **after a given node**.  
- `combined.c` → Contains **all insertion functions** together.

---

## Compilation & Execution

Use GCC (or any C compiler). Example:

gcc insertAtFront.c -o insertAtFront
./insertAtFront

For other files, replace the filename accordingly.
Example for combined:

gcc combined.c -o combined
./combined
